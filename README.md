My Projects

Exploratory Data Analysis of 3+ Million Used cars Dataset : Link Blog

Cleaned data for 3+ million containing 66 columns and analyzed data by taking a sample of 250,000 rows with 17 columns using Pandas
Created visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, geo heatmaps, etc.) using Seaborn & Plotly.
Toyota, Ford, and Chevrolet have the most number of listings in the market and the car with the most listings has SUV/Crossover body type.

Web Scrapping of the Crypto Website: Link Blog

Scraped Cryptocompare Website. We used Python, libraries such as Requests, Selenium, and Pandas to extract the details for this project.
The project scrapes the list of 100 cryptocurrencies from each tab of the page and provides details like Rank, Name, URL and Price in USD, Market cap, Volume, and Rating.
Parsed all the scraped data into a data frame and hence stored it in a CSV file containing 277 rows and 11 columns.
